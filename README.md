# Human Activity Recognition

#### The objective of the project is to extract Time Series Features for Human Activity Monitoring along with visualizing the plots for different activities and body parts for 15 individuals.
* **Task 1:**
  * Applying HVG(Horizontal Visibility Graph) and NVG(Natural Visibility Graph) to compute average degree, network diameter, and average path length. 
  * Tabulating all the data for different subjects (1-15) and axes for Head and Chest. 
  * Creating scatter plots for climbing up, climbing down, walking and running for head and chest in all directions (x,y,z)
* **Task 2:**
  * Computing Complexity and Permutation entropy for the data in all three directions (x, y, z)
  * Tabulating all the data for different subjects (1-15), axes, Embedded Dimensions (3,4,5,6) , Embedded Delay (1,2,3) and Signal Length(1024,2048,4096)
  * Creating scatter plots for climbing up, climbing down, walking and running for head and chest in all directions (x,y,z)

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from [here](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/research/projects/activity-recognition/dataset/). The Human Activity data for 15 individuals for Climbing Up, Climbing Down, Walking and Running was used for the project. The project focuses on accelerometer sensor vibration in three directions (x,y,z) for Head and Chest.
